# Expense Manager ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made_with_love_in-NYC-red)

> `expense-manager` is a utility that consolidates and categorizes all your personal financial transactions (both income and expenses), and helps you get a clear picture of where your money comes from, and where it goes üí∏

## ‚≠ê What is this?
`expense-manager` is a free utility that automates the process of consolidating and categorizing your personal financial transactions. You just need to go to your different financial accounts (checking, credit cards, etc.) to obtain a .csv file with the transactions for the period you want to analyze.

`expense-manager` automatically reads these different files, consolidates all transactions into a single view, and assigns a category to each of them, choosing from a common, standardized category list (which you could customize as needed). 
## ‚≠ê WHY would I use this?
You want to know what's in for you, so you can decide if you should keep reading or leave now; I'll help you decide in three paragraphs:

**Context:** You find value in understanding how much money you are making, how much you are spending, and in which categories. It makes you feel in control, increases your financial awareness, and helps you gradually refine/improve your decision-making abilities. In other words, it contributes to your meta-goal in life: slowly but surely steer reality towards outcomes ranking higher in your personal preferences.

- **Problem:** Your financial life has become quite complex, and you use multiple banking accounts and credit cards over any given period. You can easily download the activity/transactions for any of them, but **the .csv files you get are in slightly different formats**, and they either don't categorize your expenses, or they do but using different "buckets" and hierarchies. Consolidating all this information manually is time-consuming and error prone, and **you end up not doing it for months at a time or at all**.

- **Solution:** With this utility, **you simply download the transactions for the period you want to analyze** (last month, year-to-date, last year, etc.), you drop the files in the input folder, you run a script, **and voil√†!, you get a beautiful consolidated list with all the expenses categorized consistently**. This list is in .csv format, so you can easily analyze it using a tool like Excel (see the [What else should I know?](#what-else-should-i-know) section to see what I do)

## ‚≠ê HOW does it work?

This sounds interesting and you want to know more right? You've come to the right section:
### Prerequisites
+ Python 3
+ OpenAI API key added to your environment variables ([instructions](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/adding-your-openai-api-key-to-system-environment-variables))
+ These dependencies will be installed by the setup script:
    - `openai, langchain, tenacity, pydantic`: used to make and validate LLM API calls
    - `rapidfuzz`: used to find similar descriptions that have been categorized in the past
    - `python-dotenv`: used to load environment variables; you know this one
    - `dateparser`: date standardization

### Process outline:
1. **Read all (.csv) files** from the input folder and extract the key information required from each transaction (date, type, description, amount).

1. **Consolidate all transactions** into a single list; this typically involves some level of data wrangling.

1. Transaction descriptions are sent in batches to an OpenAI LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo), which returns the **appropriate category for each transaction**; the category list can be customized -- see next section for details.

1. The new **description-category pairs** obtained from the LLM are **stored into a reference file**.

1. In all future runs, the utility first looks up each description in this reference file.¬†If it finds one that is similar enough, it picks up the associated category and it moves on to the next transaction; **this materially reduces the number of API calls** required over time, since many transactions are repetitive in nature (we are creatures of habit).

1. The **final list** of categorized transactions is **saved into a .csv file**.  


> **NOTE:**
> `expense-manager` fully respects your privacy and doesn't collect any data at all. However, it does send the transaction descriptions (and only the descriptions) to an OpenAI LLM to obtain the associated category. OpenAI claims not to sell or use this data for any purposes, (starting on March 1st, 2023, not even to train their own models) but just be aware that's how the program works.

### Cost estimates
The OpenAI API cost per run will depend on two factors:
1. Total number of calls required
1. Cost per call, which will depend on the number of tokens per call, and the price per token (established by OpenAI)

As a point of reference, I've been using this for my own purposes with data from around 10+ different US institutions, and the average call has required around 1300 tokens. This includes both the prompt and the completion required to process 10 transactions, since we send 10 descriptions to the LLM in each call.

**TLDR:** You can process a full month for 6 to 13 cents (assuming 250 - 500 transactions per month; see table below for details)

> NOTE: These estimates are based on the pricing of the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model as of July 1st 2023 ($0.002 / 1K tokens)

## ‚≠ê HOW can I use it?
At this point you are sold and want to use this. Here's how to do it:
### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pablovazquezg/expense_manager.git
$ cd expense-manager
$ ./setup.sh
```


### Usage
---
+ Drop your .csv files in the `/data/tx_data/input` folder

+ If you want to add the new set of transactions to your historical file, you can simple run `expense-manager` now:
    ```bash
    python expense-manager.py
    ```
+ Alternatively, if you want to overwrite your historical file and create a new one, you can use the -n flag (n as in 'new'): 
    ```bash
    python expense-manager.py -n
    ```
> **NOTE:**
> Results are saved to the `/data/tx_data/output` folder

## ‚≠ê What else should I know?
- In case you don't already know, you can create a nice income/expense tracker very easily taking the output of the `expense-manager` and creating an Excel Pivot table from it; you can see an example [here](https://www.vertex42.com/blog/excel-tips/using-pivot-tables-to-analyze-income-and-expenses.html)
- The description-category pairs obtained from the LLM are stored in `/data/ref_data/ref_master_data.csv`. If in the future you want `expense-manager` to pick a different category for a specific description, you can simply update this file.
